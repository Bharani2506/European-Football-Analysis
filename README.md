# ⚽ European Football Data Analysis

Welcome to the **European Football Data Analysis** project! Dive into the world of football statistics as we analyze match results, team performance, and trends across various football leagues from 2005 to the present. This project uses an SQLite database and a mix of **Python** and **SQL** to explore football data and uncover key insights.

## 🗂️ Dataset Overview

The dataset, available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/groleo/european-football-database), is stored in an **SQLite database** (`european_database.sqlite`). It contains crucial data for European football matches. Here’s a quick look at the two core tables:

- **`matchs` table**: Contains detailed match info including match date, teams, results, and more.
- **`divisions` table**: Provides data about football divisions (countries, league names, etc.).
